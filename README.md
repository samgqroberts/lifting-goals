## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Follow the instructions there to find your way around.

Otherwise, the only noteworthy dependency is [superstructjs](https://docs.superstructjs.org/), to aid in well-typed serialization / deserialization of TypeScript types into JSON to be stored in localstorage.
